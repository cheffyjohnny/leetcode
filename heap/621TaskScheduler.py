# 📖 Problem
# You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n. 
# Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, 
# but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.

# Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

# 💻
# Example 1:
# Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
# Output: 8
# Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
# After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

# Example 2:
# Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
# Output: 6
# Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
# With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

# Example 3:
# Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
# There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.
